# wordle_clone

This is a word guessing game build using Python 'pygame' module to build the GUI.

We have a data set containing 5 letter english words and a random word will be picked. 
You need to guess that particular word by the following the rules below.

Rules to play:
* You need to guess a 5 letter english word and you can have a maximum 6 chances to guess the word correctly
* You can observe after entering your first word, if all the letters have a bg colour grey "None of the word is present in the correct word"
* If you observe any letters with YELLOW Bg colour "That letter is present in the correct word but misplaced"
* If you observe any letter with GREEN bg colour "That letter is present in the correct word and position is also correct"

By using these clues you can guess the word correctly!

Once you Enter the correct word the bg colour will be turned into GREEN and you have guessed the correct word!

Thank you!
